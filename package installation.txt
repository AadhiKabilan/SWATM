If you've downloaded the source files (typically `.tar.gz` or `.zip` archives) for the packages, you can install them on the offline system by following these steps:

### Steps to Install Source Packages:

1. **Copy the Source Files**:
   Transfer the source package files (e.g., `pyodbc-4.0.30.tar.gz`, `Flask-2.2.2.tar.gz`, etc.) to your offline system. Place them in a directory (for example, `C:\offline_packages\` on Windows or `/home/user/offline_packages/` on Linux).

2. **Extract the Source Files (if necessary)**:
   If the source files are in `.tar.gz` or `.zip` format, extract them first:
   - On **Windows**, you can use any file extraction tool like WinRAR or 7-Zip to extract the files.
   - On **Linux** or **macOS**, you can use the `tar` command:
     ```bash
     tar -xvzf pyodbc-4.0.30.tar.gz
     ```

3. **Install the Dependencies**:
   Open a terminal or command prompt on your offline system, navigate to the directory where you extracted the source files, and use `pip` to install them.

   **For example**:
   - Navigate to the extracted folder:
     ```bash
     cd C:\offline_packages\pyodbc-4.0.30
     ```
     (or on Linux/Mac: `cd /home/user/offline_packages/pyodbc-4.0.30`)

   - Run the following command to install the package:
     ```bash
     pip install .
     ```
     The `.` refers to the current directory, which contains the `setup.py` file (used by `pip` to install the package).

4. **Install Other Dependencies**:
   Repeat the same process for other packages you need, such as Flask:
   - Navigate to the extracted Flask source folder:
     ```bash
     cd C:\offline_packages\Flask-2.2.2
     ```
   - Then, install it using:
     ```bash
     pip install .
     ```

5. **Resolve Any Missing Dependencies**:
   While installing the packages from source, `pip` will try to install any missing dependencies automatically. However, if you're offline, you might encounter errors about missing dependencies (such as `setuptools` or `wheel`).

   To install `setuptools` and `wheel`, which are common requirements, follow these steps:

   - Download their source files (e.g., `setuptools-67.8.0.tar.gz`, `wheel-0.37.1.tar.gz`) from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/setuptools/) and [Wheel](https://pypi.org/project/wheel/).
   - Install `setuptools` and `wheel` first before installing other packages:
     ```bash
     pip install C:\offline_packages\setuptools-67.8.0.tar.gz
     pip install C:\offline_packages\wheel-0.37.1.tar.gz
     ```

6. **Handle Errors**:
   If any errors occur during installation (e.g., missing C++ compilers for `pyodbc` or other dependencies), you may need to install additional system libraries or compilers.

   - On **Windows**, make sure you have Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools installed to compile packages like `pyodbc`. You can download it from [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/).
   - On **Linux** (Debian-based systems like Ubuntu), you can install build tools by running:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install build-essential
     ```

7. **Verify Installation**:
   After installing the packages, you can check if everything installed properly by running the following command in the Python environment:
   ```bash
   python -m pip show pyodbc Flask
   ```

   This will show information about the installed packages if they were installed correctly.
